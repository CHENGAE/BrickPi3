## Installing

For installing the BrickPi3, you should only use the following command:
```
sudo curl -kL dexterindustries.com/update_brickpi3
```

Since `dexterindustries.com/update_brickpi3` points to this folder's file called `update_brickpi3.sh` you can also type in the following command:
```
sudo bash update_brickpi3.sh
```
